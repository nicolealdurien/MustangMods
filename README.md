* **Purpose of the app:** <br/><br/>
    Mustang Mods is a fully responsive e-commerce site that would serve a shop selling pony car modification and enhancement parts. The site was built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node) as well as Redux.

* **Features:** 

    The homepage lists the products with titles, images, prices, short descriptions, and a link to the details page for each product. Products are populated from the mongoDB database.
    
    The product details page lists all the same product info from the homepage with a longer description. The quantity selector and add-to-cart button are on this page.




    Separate information pages are also part of the site:
    - The wasteNOT landing page includes information about the program, about restaurant food donation in general, and about the impacts of food waste.
    - The Hearts Feeding H-town homepage (the theoretical organization sponsoring the wasteNOT program) includes further information about how donations are collected and distributed, a "Thank You" section listing all past/current restaurants who've donated, and a link to another page listing food bank locations in our distribution network.
    - The food bank locations page lists all food banks in the WN/HFH network, along with each food bank's address, website, and hours of operation.
