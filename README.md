* **Purpose of the app:** <br/><br/>
    Mustang Mods is a fully responsive e-commerce site that would serve a shop selling pony car modification and enhancement parts. The site was built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node) as well as Redux.

* **Features:** 

    The homepage lists the products with titles, images, prices, short descriptions, and a link to the details page for each product. Products are populated from the mongoDB database.
    
    The product details page lists all the same product info from the homepage with a longer description. The quantity selector and add-to-cart button are on this page. If an item is out of stock, this will be displayed on the details page and the quantity selector is blanked out.
